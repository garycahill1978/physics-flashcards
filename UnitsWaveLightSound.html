  { topic: "Units", term: "What is the circumference of the Earth at the equator?", equation: "C = 2πR ≈ 40,075 km", answer: "The Earth's equatorial circumference is ≈ 40,075 km — slightly larger than the polar circumference because of the equatorial bulge from Earth's rotation.", svg: "" },

  { topic: "Units", term: "What are common metric prefixes for length?", equation: "1 km = 10^3 m; 1 m = 10^0 m; 1 cm = 10^-2 m; 1 mm = 10^-3 m; 1 μm = 10^-6 m; 1 nm = 10^-9 m", answer: "Metric prefixes modify base units by powers of ten: kilometre, centimetre, millimetre, micrometre (μm), nanometre (nm).", svg: "" },

  { topic: "Units", term: "What is the Earth's polar circumference?", equation: "C(polar) ≈ 40,008 km", answer: "The Earth's polar circumference is about 40,008 km. The metre was originally tied to Earth's meridian distance (1/10,000,000 of the equator–pole arc).", svg: "" },

  { topic: "Units", term: "What causes the phases of the Moon, and what is a 'moonth'?", equation: "Lunar cycle ≈ 29.5 days", answer: "Phases are caused by the Moon's changing position relative to Earth and the Sun. A full cycle takes about 29.5 days — the origin of the word 'moonth' (modern: month).", svg: "" },

  { topic: "Units", term: "Why do we always see the same side of the Moon?", equation: "Rotation period = orbital period", answer: "The Moon rotates once on its axis every 27.3 days — the same time it takes to orbit Earth.
