// 🔁 Your flashcards array remains unchanged, just ensure equations are simple LaTeX like "V = IR"


const flashcards = [

 {
    "term": "What are the SI base units for mass, length, and time?",
    "equation": "kg, m, s",
    "answer": "Kilogram (kg), metre (m), and second (s)."
  },
{
  "term": "What is the circumference of the Earth at the equator?",
  "equation": "C = 2\\pi R \\approx 40,075\\,\\text{km}",
  "answer": "The Earth's equatorial circumference is approximately 40,075 km. Slightly than the polar circumference due to the bulging at the equator caused by Earth’s rotation.."
},
{
  "term": "What are common metric prefixes for length?",
  "equation": "\\begin{aligned} &1\\,\\text{km} = 10^3\\,\\text{m} \\\\ &1\\,\\text{m} = 10^0\\,\\text{m} \\\\ &1\\,\\text{cm} = 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m} \\\\ &1\\,\\text{mm} = 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} \\\\ &1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} \\\\ &1\\,\\text{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m} \\end{aligned}",
  "answer": "Metric prefixes modify base units by powers of ten. For example: kilometre, centimetre, millimetre, micrometre (μm), and nanometre (nm)."
},
{
  "term": "What is the Earth's polar circumference?",
  "equation": "C_{\\text{polar}} \\approx 40,008\\,\\text{km}",
  "answer": "The Earth's polar circumference is about 40,008 km. The metre was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a meridian. "
},
{
  "term": "What causes the phases of the Moon, and what is a 'moonth'?",
  "equation": "\\text{Lunar cycle} \\approx 29.5\\,\\text{days}",
  "answer": "Phases are caused by the Moon's changing position relative to the Earth and Sun. A full cycle takes ~29.5 days — the origin of the word 'moonth' (modern: month)."
},
{
  "term": "Why do we always see the same side of the Moon?",
  "equation": "\\text{Rotation period} = \\text{Orbital period}",
  "answer": "The Moon rotates once on its axis every 27.3 days — the same time it takes to orbit Earth. This is called synchronous rotation, causing the same side to always face Earth."
},
{
  "term": "How does the Moon cause tides?",
  "equation": "F_{\\text{gravity}} \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}",
  "answer": "The Earth pulls the Moon and the Moon pulls the Earths. Moon's gravity pulls on Earth's oceans, creating tidal bulges. As Earth rotates, this causes two high and two low tides per day."
},
{
  "term": "Why are high tides about an hour later each day?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{lunar day} \\approx 24\\,\\text{h}~50\\,\\text{min}",
  "answer": "The Moon moves eastward in its orbit each day. Earth must rotate about 50 extra minutes to realign with the Moon, so high tides occur roughly an hour later each day."
},
{
  "term": "Is the Moon the only object that moves eastward?",
  "equation": "\\text{All orbiting bodies drift east relative to stars}",
  "answer": "No — the Moon, Sun, and planets all move eastward relative to the background stars over time. Their daily westward motion is due to Earth's rotation."
},
{
  "term": "How do the Moon and Sun move across the sky each day?",
  "equation": "\\text{Sun: } 15^\\circ/\\text{hour west} \\quad \\text{Moon: } \\approx 13^\\circ/\\text{day east}",
  "answer": "The Sun appears to move west at 15° per hour due to Earth’s rotation. The Moon also appears to move west daily, but it shifts about 13° eastward each day relative to the stars — causing tides to occur ~50 minutes later each day."
},
{
  "term": "What is the angular size of the Moon and Sun in the sky?",
  "equation": "\\theta \\approx 0.5^\\circ",
  "answer": "The Moon and Sun both appear about 0.5° wide — roughly half the width of your little finger held at arm’s length. This similar angular size allows total solar eclipses to occur."
},
{
  "term": "How was the metre originally defined?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{m} = \\frac{1}{10,000,000}\\,\\text{distance from Equator to Pole}",
  "answer": "In the 1790s, the metre was defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a meridian — aiming to base units on natural Earth measurements."
},
{
  "term": "What is the mass of 1 litre of water?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{L} = 1\\,\\text{kg}",
  "answer": "1 litre of water has a mass of 1 kilogram at 4°C."
},
{
  "term": "How can a ruler help estimate angles at arm's length?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{cm at 57 cm} \\approx 1^\\circ",
  "answer": "Holding a ruler at arm’s length (~57 cm), each centimetre on the scale spans about 1°. This links linear scale (cm) to angular measurement using the small-angle formula."
},
{
  "term": "How many cubic centimetres are in 1 litre?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{L} = 1000\\,\\text{cm}^3",
  "answer": "A litre is defined as 1,000 cubic centimetres."
},
{
  "term": "What is the distance from Earth to the Moon in light-seconds?",
  "equation": "t = \\frac{384,400\\,\\text{km}}{3\\times10^5\\,\\text{km/s}} \\approx 1.28\\,\\text{s}",
  "answer": "About 1.3 seconds — that's how long light takes to reach the Moon."
},
{
  "term": "What is the distance from Earth to the Sun in light-seconds?",
  "equation": "t = \\frac{1.5 \\times10^8\\,\\text{km}}{3\\times10^5\\,\\text{km/s}} \\approx 500\\,\\text{s}",
  "answer": "Approximately 500 seconds — or about 8 minutes and 20 seconds."
},
{
  "term": "How many millilitres are in 1 litre?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{L} = 1000\\,\\text{mL}",
  "answer": "One litre is 1,000 millilitres or 1,000 cm^3."
},
{
  "term": "What does a kilogram measure?",
  "equation": "\\text{kg = unit of mass}",
  "answer": "The kilogram is the base SI unit of mass."
},
{
  "term": "What does a litre measure?",
  "equation": "\\text{L = unit of volume}",
  "answer": "The litre is a non-SI unit of volume, equal to 0.001 cubic metres."
},
{
  "term": "Why is water used to define mass and volume standards?",
  "equation": "\\text{Density of water} = 1\\,\\text{kg/L}",
  "answer": "Because its properties are stable and well-known — 1 L of water = 1 kg. Density = 1 g/cm^3, 1000 kg/m^3"
},
{
  "term": "How far is a light-second in kilometres?",
  "equation": "d = c \\cdot t = 3 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m} = 300,000\\,\\text{km}",
  "answer": "Light travels approximately 300,000 km in one second."
},
  {
    "term": "What is the SI unit of force?",
    "equation": "1\\,\\text{N} = 1\\,\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2",
    "answer": "A newton (N) is the force required to accelerate 1 kg at 1 m/s²."
  },
  {
    "term": "What is a derived unit?",
    "equation": "\\text{e.g.} \\quad \\text{Pa} = \\frac{N}{m^2}",
    "answer": "A unit made by combining base units, like pascal (Pa) for pressure."
  },
  {
    "term": "Define measurement uncertainty.",
    "equation": "\\Delta x = \\pm 0.1\\,\\text{cm}",
    "answer": "It tells how much the measured value could differ from the true value."
  },
  {
    "term": "How do you reduce uncertainty?",
    "equation": "\\text{Uncertainty} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}",
    "answer": "Take repeated measurements and average the results."
  },
  {
    "term": "What is accuracy?",
    "equation": "\\text{Close to true value}",
    "answer": "How close a measurement is to the correct or accepted value."
  },
  {
    "term": "What is precision?",
    "equation": "\\text{Repeatable results}",
    "answer": "How consistent repeated measurements are."
  },
  {
    "term": "Give an example of a precise but inaccurate measurement.",
    "equation": "\\text{Systematic error}",
    "answer": "A miscalibrated scale that always gives the same wrong weight."
  },
  {
    "term": "What is the purpose of calibration?",
    "equation": "\\text{Adjust to standard value}",
    "answer": "To check or correct the accuracy of an instrument."
  },
  {
    "term": "What is the smallest scale division on a standard metre stick?",
    "equation": "\\pm 0.1\\,\\text{cm}",
    "answer": "Typically 1 mm (0.1 cm), so the uncertainty is ±0.05 or ±0.1 cm."
  },
  {
    "term": "What instrument do you use to measure a human hair’s diameter?",
    "equation": "\\text{Micrometer}",
    "answer": "A micrometer screw gauge or a digital calipers. (Typical value 100 microns or 0.1 mm)"
  },
{
  "term": "What is the average width of a human hair?",
  "equation": "\\mu \\approx 70\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.07\\,\\text{mm},\\quad \\sigma \\approx 20\\,\\mu\\text{m}",
  "answer": "The average width of a human hair is about 70 micrometers (µm), or 0.07 mm, with a standard deviation of ±20 µm."
},
{
  "term": "How long are a day and a year in standard timekeeping?",
  "equation": "1\\,\\text{day} = 24\\,\\text{hours},\\quad 1\\,\\text{year} \\approx 365.25\\,\\text{days}",
  "answer": "A day is defined as 24 hours. A year is about 365.25 days — the extra 0.25 is why we add a leap day (Feb 29th) every 4 years."
},
{
  "term": "What does 'anticlockwise from the North' mean in astronomy?",
  "equation": "\\text{Most planets and moons orbit and rotate anticlockwise}",
  "answer": "Viewed from above the North Pole, the Sun spins, planets orbit, and most moons orbit anticlockwise. Venus rotates clockwise (retrograde), and Uranus spins on its side (~98° tilt)."
},
{
  "term": "Where does the Imperial system come from?",
  "equation": "\\text{King John, 13th century England}",
  "answer": "The Imperial system of measurement (feet, inches, pounds) has roots in medieval England. Units were formalised under King John — one of history’s least popular monarchs!"
},
{
  "term": "What is the tilt of the Earth's axis?",
  "equation": "\\theta \\approx 23.45^\\circ",
  "answer": "Earth’s axis is tilted about 23.45° from vertical. This axial tilt causes the seasons as Earth orbits the Sun."
},
